            "The Dermatology Life Quality Index or DLQI, developed in 1994, was the first dermatology-specific Quality of Life instrument. \n" +
            "\n" +
            "It is a simple 10-question validated questionnaire which has been used in 33 different skin conditions in 32 countries and is available in 55 languages.\n " +
            "\n" +
            "Its use has been described in over 500 publications including 30 multinational studies.\n " +

            "What is Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)\n" +
            "A patientâ€™s Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is a measure of overall psoriasis severity and coverage. It is a commonly-used measure in clinical trials for psoriasis treatments.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "PASI consists of two major steps:\n" +
            "1) calculating the BSA (Body Surface Area) covered with lesions and\n" +
            "2) assessment of the severity of lesions.\n" +
            "The second step in turn consists of assessing lesions' erythema (redness), induration (thickness) and scaling.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "All calculations are combined into a single score (PASI Score) in the range of 0 (no psoriasis on the body) and up to 72 (the most severe case of psoriasis).\n" +
            "Typically, the PASI would be calculated before, during and after a treatment period in order to determine how well psoriasis responds to the treatment.\n" + "\n" +  "\n" +
